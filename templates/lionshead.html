                <p>
                    This is the most popular hike in Cape Town during any time of the year. The remarkable views of Cape Town and its beautiful sunset
                    are on complete display at the top of Lion's Head. This hike is relatively short but do not underestimate its intensity: it is a <b>full</b> workout to the top.
                    The route is easy to follow with clear markings, and the ground is relatively stable. There is some rock scrambling required closer to the top, where there are 
                    ropes and metal ladders to offer support.<br><br>
                    The route is both child- and dog-friendly, provided you have a permit for the dog. When bringing children, it may be best to skip the scrambling and take
                    the walkaround path. This is the first hike for most in Cape Town, but has a lasting impression that has definitely converted non-hikers to hikers many times over.
